# CS424: Visualization and Visual Analytics - Assignment - 1
## Chicago Traffic Tracker

### Task 1: Data description
The Chicago Traffic Tracker dataset is a comprehensive collection of historical estimated congestion data for over 1,000 traffic segments in Chicago, starting from around March 2018. This dataset is a valuable resource for understanding traffic conditions on the city's arterial streets, and it comprises 275 million rows and 22 columns of attributes. The congestion estimates are generated every 10 minutes by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. The dataset provides information on estimated traffic speed, street names, traffic flow direction, segment length, and various other attributes. It also offers congestion estimates at both the segment and regional levels, making it useful for a wide range of applications, including traffic management, urban planning, transportation research, and public transit optimization. Researchers, city planners, traffic engineers, and transportation companies are among the potential users who can leverage this dataset to gain insights into Chicago's traffic patterns and make data-driven decisions to improve traffic flow and urban mobility. 

### Task 2: Domain questions

#### 1. How does congestion vary by time of day and day of the week?
- Reasoning: This question would help us understand the daily and weekly traffic patterns in Chicago. Visualizing the average traffic speed (attribute: SPEED) by hour of the day (attribute: HOUR) and day of the week (attribute: DAY_OF_WEEK) could reveal peak congestion times and highlight differences between weekdays and weekends.

#### 2. Which arterial streets experience the worst congestion?
- Reasoning: By visualizing the congestion levels on different arterial streets (attribute: STREET), we can identify which streets consistently have the highest congestion rates. This information can be valuable for city planners and commuters seeking alternative routes.

#### 3. What is the impact of bus count on congestion?
- Reasoning: Investigating the relationship between the number of buses providing GPS data (attribute: BUS_COUNT) and congestion levels (attribute: SPEED) through visualization can help determine if there's a correlation. It could shed light on how public transit affects traffic flow.

#### 4. What role does the weather play in congestion during Winters and Summers? Are there any trends in different months?
- Reasoning: Exploring congestion patterns during Winters and Summers (attribute: MONTH) can reveal any seasonal variations in traffic. Visualizations can show weather conditions, impact congestion levels (attribute: STREET), helping with traffic management and event planning.

#### 5. Are there specific traffic segments that consistently experience high or low congestion? 
- Reasoning: Heatmaps based on historical congestion data can pinpoint segments with persistent traffic problems, which can be crucial for identifying areas requiring road network improvements (attributes: SEGMENT_ID, SPEED).

#### 6. What is the relationship between segment length (attribute: LENGTH) and traffic congestion? 
- Reasoning: By visualizing congestion levels against the length of traffic segments, it's possible to determine if there is a correlation between the physical length of a road segment and the likelihood of congestion. This can inform decisions about road design, lane expansions, or traffic signal optimization for specific segment types based on their lengths.

#### 7. How did the COVID-19 affect the traffic patterns in the city of Chicago?
- Reasoning: By Visualizing traffic patterns in the years 2019-2020 and 2021-2022. We can determine the traffic congestion levels across different areas of Chicago. We can use a Choropleth map that displays traffic patterns across different areas of Chicago. (attributes: TIME, STREET, SPEED).

Strengths include clarity in showing peak congestion times (Heatmap) and overall trends (Line Chart). However, they might not capture fine-grained details within days (Weakness).

2. Worst Congested Arterial Streets: The choropleth map and bar chart efficiently identify highly congested streets. The strengths lie in pinpointing problematic areas (Choropleth) and providing direct street-level information (Bar Chart). However, the bar chart lacks broader trend insights (Weakness).

3. Bus Count Impact: Time series, hexbin plot, and bubble chart effectively illustrate the relationship between bus count and congestion. They offer insights into bus count patterns (Time Series), point density (Hexbin Plot), and multiple variables (Bubble Chart).

4. Weather and Seasonal Trends: Box plots and seasonal congestion stacked area charts are suitable for analyzing seasonal trends. Box plots reveal variations by month, while stacked area charts visualize month-to-month comparisons. Both provide insights into seasonal variations but may become complex with many months.

5. Consistent Congestion in Segments: Bar charts, bubble charts, and radar charts help identify consistently congested segments. The bar chart is effective in listing top segments, while the bubble chart and radar chart provide insights into congestion patterns over time. However, they can become cluttered with excessive data.

6. Segment Length and Congestion: Violin plots, scatter plots, and parallel coordinates plots explore the relationship between segment length and congestion. Violin plots offer rich distribution insights (Strength) but might be less familiar to users (Weakness). Scatter plots provide a clear view of congestion within length ranges. Parallel coordinates plots effectively show how congestion levels change with different segment lengths but may become complex with many segments.

7. COVID-19 Impact: The density map and grouped bar chart are well-suited for understanding the impact of COVID-19 on traffic patterns. The density map provides a clear before-and-after view (Strength), but it may not explain the causes of changes (Weakness). The grouped bar chart efficiently compares bus count and speed before and after the pandemic, but it may not capture all factors influencing traffic patterns during the pandemic.

In summary, each visualization has its strengths and weaknesses, and their effectiveness in answering the domain questions varies. A combination of these visualizations would be most effective in providing a comprehensive understanding of Chicago's traffic patterns. For instance, combining the heatmap with the weekly average congestion line chart can answer Question 1 effectively, while the density map and grouped bar chart can address the impact of COVID-19 (Question 7).
